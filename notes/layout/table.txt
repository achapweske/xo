If the height of the content of a td is given as a percentage, it is computed relative to:
-If height of td is given explicitly (in pixels), then use that height
-Else if height of td OR tr are given as a percentage, then use the *actual* height of the row
-Else use auto

tr heights are interpreted as minimum height for that row, so setting it to 0.1% is essentially the same as auto/0.

So to get desired behavior, make sure all rows have a height set and default to 0.1%.

If the height of the content of a td is given as a percentage, it is computed relative to:
-If height of td is given (in pixels or perecent), then use that height
-Else use auto

When the height for a td is specified as a percent, it is interpreted as relative to the used height of the table.

So to get desired behavior, all table cells must have a height set explicitly.
